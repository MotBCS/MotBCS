I'm an enthusiastic, self-driven, and detailed oriented computer science student, with an appetite for knowledge. I have experience in developing user-friendly software applications, coding, and testing features. Practice in multiple programming languages and software development tools, excellent problem-solving skills, and the ability to perform well in a collaborative team environment. I am eager to obtain a challenging position that will expand my learning and build upon my developer skills.
